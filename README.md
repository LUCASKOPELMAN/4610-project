# Problem Description
The task at hand is to design and implement a relational database that accurately models the core functions of a doctor’s office management system. The goal of this project is to create a structured and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage patient records, doctor information, medical treatments, prescriptions, insurance details, and appointments.
The doctor’s office system handles a variety of operations, including patient check-ins, medical diagnoses, treatment plans, prescriptions, and insurance claims processing. The database is designed to streamline data management, reduce redundancy, and improve access to patient care records while ensuring accuracy and integrity.

# Queries 

1. Query 1 allows a user to list doctors with their specialization and years of experience.

- This query could be used when an individual wants to find an experienced doctor for a specific specialty. Because it sorts the doctors by year of experience descending, the first doctor returned will be the most experienced. This could be used in a case where someone with vast background knowledge is needed for a specific condition.

3. Query 3 gets all past appointments scheduled before the current date.

- Hospitals need to know all past appointments to keep track of patient history and make sure they get proper care. It helps doctors see what treatments/check-ups a patient has already had, so they don’t repeat tests or miss important follow-ups. It also helps with scheduling, spotting missed appointments, and understanding patient needs over time. Plus, past appointments are useful for billing, insurance claims, and keeping medical records accurate. Without this information, it would be harder to give the best care and keep everything organized.


6. Query 6 finds Patients Diagnosed with a Specific Disease (in this case, asthma)

- Hospitals need to know which patients have a certain disease so they can give them the right care. It helps doctors keep track of who needs treatment, follow-ups, or special attention. It also makes sure the hospital has enough medicine and equipment for those patients. Plus, knowing this can help spot outbreaks and find better ways to treat the disease- for research purposes. Without this info, it would be harder to make sure patients get the right care when they need it.
