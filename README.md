# Problem Description
The task at hand is to design and implement a relational database that accurately models the core functions of a doctor’s office management system. The goal of this project is to create a structured and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manage patient records, doctor information, medical treatments, prescriptions, insurance details, and appointments.
The doctor’s office system handles a variety of operations, including patient check-ins, medical diagnoses, treatment plans, prescriptions, and insurance claims processing. The database is designed to streamline data management, reduce redundancy, and improve access to patient care records while ensuring accuracy and integrity.

- This query could be used when an individual wants to find an experienced doctor for a specific specialty. Because it sorts the doctors by year of experience descending, the first doctor returned will be the most experienced. This could be used in a case where someone with vast background knowledge is needed for a specific condition.
